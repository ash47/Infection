Infection
=========

This is a sourcemod.js plugin.

###How do I play?###
 - Everyone spawns onto radiant in the start.
 - Up to three people are selected to become a zombie
 - These people will then turn into a zombie after 60 seconds, use this time to setup a trap, or retreat to dire base, if you have no skill
 - If you die as a Radiant, you will respawn after 5 seconds (where you died) as a zombie!

###Zombies Mechanics###
 - Zombies respawn after 2 seconds
 - Zombies move very slowly (~220)
 - Zombies get 30 + 4 * level of each stat
 - Zombies get feast, teleportation and brood's venom
 - Zombies get one leap skill, one trap skill and one utility skill

###Alpha Zombie###
 - The first zombie to spawn is the alpha zombie
 - The alpha zombie gets +30 stats, +30 movespeed and +3 armor
 - The alpha zombie can also buy items -- if he gives items to other zombies, they will be deleted!
 - You can type -z to volunteer at the start of the game to become the Alpha Zombie
